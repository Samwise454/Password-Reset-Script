Hi, this is a quick php/sql/javascript(ajax) script for login, signup and password recovery.

As you know there are lots of ways to achieve same goal in programming, so feel free to update my code and share the update let's learn :-).

Ajax was used for the form handling, you can link ajax via cdn or use the one in the folder.

Descriptions have been dropped intermittently inside the scripts to help you understand what is happening @ various intervals.

For the mail() function in php, it requires smtp and other configurations to be able to send mail but for the purpose of localhost, mail() was commented out and $selector and $validator variables passed directly thereby bypassing getting it from an email.

There are 2 main visible pages, index and home, others are scripts and files to be required e.g header and footer.

You can also make use of phpmailer.

XAMPP was the dev server used for this.

Feel free to add and remove from the code and contact me via twitter: @austines96
